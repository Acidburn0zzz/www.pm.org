<h1>Inviting a Guru to Your Meeting</h1>

<p>
Many of the Perl personalities travel the country teaching
Perl or doing other Important Things.  Find out when they
are near you and send them a note.  The persons listed on
this page have expressed an interest in attending local user
groups events when they are in town, so don't be afraid to
offer them free drinks and dinner! Include the time frame
(for instance: &quot;sometime in May or June&quot;) and the
location of your meeting in your invitation.
