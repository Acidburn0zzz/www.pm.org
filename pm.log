PM.log

TODO
=======
- go over all the PM groups, and contact the group leader that have no web site or
  where the web site is broken.
  - mark the group as inactive if I the mail bounces or if the group leader tells so
    or if no answer is received within a week.
  - later check the other resources of these groups 
    (mailing list, DNS of the group name, what else?)
    remove the DNS
    freeze the mailing list if it has archive or delete it if there is 
    no content in the archive (backup list of users?)

- remove the webmaster@pm.org address from the contact list as it goes to the same
  place as support.pm.org and that will reduce any potential confusion.

- include the link to the pm group to the page listing the groups on the continent
- on the individual pm pages (if we keep them) include the name of the group and 
  other info in the html title (e.g. links to the mailing list pages or instructions
  how to sign up).

- Once utf-8 is enabled add language links to the left side of the pm.org we site
- clean up the "Invite a guru" page - remove most of the people, maybe change the whole 
  title ("guru ?") ask who else wants to be added
- move all the entries that are not 'alive' to another xml file

- add multiple "langauge" fields to each pm group
- create pages grouping the groups according to language  German", "French"

- list the valid status values and their meaning (and probably better to reduce the list of valid values)
  active
  inactive
  mlb
  leb
  disbanded
  sleeping
  Vetoed by Robert...  (I guess this should be in a separate field or in a comment)
  unknown
- add status to groups that do not have one
- improve the bin/ping.pl (or the bin/xml ?) to validate that the fields in the
  xml file are valid values and are not missing.
- Setup Nagios to monitor the websites?
