PM.log

TODO
=======
- list the valid status values and their meaning (and probably better to reduce the list of valid values)
  active
  inactive
  mlb
  leb
  disbanded
  sleeping
  Vetoed by Robert...  (I guess this should be in a separate field or in a comment)
  unknown
- add status to groups that do not have one

- Reagrding status I think we need
  - active 
  - XXX  (could be inactive, sleeping or dormant) - 
     this should be still displayed on the web, the mailing list if exists
     should be linked and we should display a message saying that the list 
     went dromant but there are messages in the archive and if the person is 
     interested s/he should contact support@pm.org
  - YYY (dead ??) Lists that once existed but now they don't have a website
     and there was no mailing list or no content in the archive
     (in which case we can remove the mailing list)
     We don't show these on the web site.
  That's it, is there are other kind of status? What about cases where the group
  used only external services (its own web site and mailing list) and they are
  gone?

- Maybe there should be a field in the XML for some free text that can be displayed
  on the web site explaining the situaton of specific groups.

- move all the entries that are not 'alive' to another xml file

- add multiple "language" fields to each pm group

- create pages grouping the groups according to language  German", "French"

- What is pm_admins@pm.org ? (I have it in Gmail)


More TODO
=========

- go over all the PM groups, and contact the group leader that have no web site or
  where the web site is broken.
  - mark the group as inactive if I the mail bounces or if the group leader tells so
    or if no answer is received within a week.
  - later check the other resources of these groups 
    (mailing list, DNS of the group name, what else?)
    remove the DNS
    freeze the mailing list if it has archive or delete it if there is 
    no content in the archive (backup list of users?)

- include the link to the pm group to the page listing the groups on the continent

- on the individual pm pages (if we keep them) include the name of the group and 
  other info in the html title (e.g. links to the mailing list pages or instructions
  how to sign up).

- Once utf-8 is enabled add language links to the left side of the pm.org we site

- clean up the "Invite a guru" page - remove most of the people, maybe change the whole 
  title ("guru ?") ask who else wants to be added



- improve the bin/ping.pl (or the bin/xml ?) to validate that the fields in the
  xml file are valid values and are not missing.
- Setup Nagios to monitor the websites?

- using the PM mailing list for more discussion on how to attract more users?

- Implement some game asking for people to reate the web sites of the PM groups
  or to adpot a pm group or some other way to draw more attention to each group.
  "Adopt a pm group" to get other individuals help with pushing the group forward?
  "Introduce a PM group a day" - every day visit another PM group, analyse their web site
  
- Somehow get the PM groups to publish blogs about their activity that we can 
  then collect and either syndicate in a planet or send as a feed to the various 
  perl planets and aggregators.



- Remove mailing lists:
  - Aalesund.pm
  - Africa.pm
