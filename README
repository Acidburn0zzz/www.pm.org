Directory layout is as follows:

bin/ 
  contains programs to build the site etc.
lib/
  contains Template Toolkit templates
src/
  contains the actual text of the site
www/
  the output goes here

To build the site, run "bin/xml" from this directory.

To upload the site or a single file run "perl bin/dav2pm"


What this does is it takes the source files from src/ applies any
templates to them (from lib/), and writes the output to the www/
directory. Now have a look at the www directory - it contains the
site!

lib/layout is the template which is applied to every page.

Note: whenever you refer to a page on our site inside a template,
please use the following mechanism, which changes the link to a
relative one so that we can build the site anywhere we want:

  See [% link_to("foo.html", "the best foo") %].
