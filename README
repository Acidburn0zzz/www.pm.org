Directory layout is as follows:

bin/ 
  contains programs to build the site etc.
lib/
  contains Template Toolkit templates
src/
  contains the actual text of the site
www/
  the output goes here

To build the site, run "bin/xml" from this directory. 

What this does is it takes the source files from src/ applies any
templates to them (from lib/), and writes the output to the www/
directory. Now have a look at the www directory - it contains the
site!

lib/layout is the template which is applied to every page.

   -----------------------------------
   ADMINISTRATOR NOTE:
   If you're a www.pm.org admin, then your local www directory is a symlink into a 
   WebDAV mount of https://groups.pm.org/admin/. For example, in OS X:
   
      ln -s /Volumes/admin/groups/www www
   
   At that point, when you run "bin/xml" you're publishing the output directly to 
   www.pm.org.
   -----------------------------------

Note: whenever you refer to a page on our site inside a template,
please use the following mechanism, which changes the link to a
relative one so that we can build the site anywhere we want:

  See [% link_to("foo.html", "the best foo") %].
